cyano = Backer.create(undername: "Cyanobacteria", description: "Cyanobacteria are also commonly referred to as blue-green algae, due to their color which results from the presence of some pigments used in photosynthesis.  As prokaryotes, all cyanobacteria are single-celled, relatively simple organisms.  While this is true, in many species individual cells will cluster together and form globular or filamentous colonies.  Some of these colonies even experience some differentiation, with certain cells taking on a different appearance and becoming specialized for nitrogen fixation.", applications: "Cyanobacteria are important producers in many ecosystems, especially aquatic ones.  Along with many protists, cyanobacteria comprise much of the “algae” at the base of the food chain in lakes and ponds.  These organisms are of special interest to scientists for two very important reasons.  First, biologists commonly agree that some ancient cyanobacterium was the ancestor of the chloroplasts that are found in many modern eukaryotic organisms.  This theory, known as endosymbiosis theory, proposes that an ancestral cyanobacterium was engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell, which did not digest the cyanobacterium.  Instead, the cyanobacterium lived symbiotically inside of its new host, eventually evolved away its independence as a separate organism, and developed into the chloroplasts we observe today.  Evidence for this theory is quite abundant and includes a) the fact that chloroplasts have two plasma membranes, one that is very bacterial in nature b) the ability of chloroplasts to regulate many of their own activities, such as division, and c) the fact that chloroplasts contain their own DNA, which is very similar to the DNA in living cyanobacteria!  Another reason that cyanobacteria are regularly studied is due to the fact that they are the only prokaryotes that produce oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis.  Fossil evidence tells scientists that ancient cyanobacteria existed on Earth billions of years ago.  Scientists agree that once oxygen-producing photosynthesis evolved in these ancient cyanobacteria, it very likely changed the composition of the atmosphere from a reducing one to one rich in O2!  This radically changed the chemical conditions on our planet and made life as we know it, most of which is heavily dependent on oxygen, possible.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Many cyanobacterial species consist of single-celled organisms linked together in long filamentous colonies")

gpb = Backer.create(undername: "Gram-Positive Bacteria", description: "Gram-positive bacteria are foremost a type of bacteria, meaning that they are unicellular organisms which consist of relatively simple prokaryotic cells.  This group is referred to as “gram-positive”, because they produce a positive result when exposed to the crystal violet dye during a common microbiological technique called a gram stain.  Because these bacteria have a thicker cell wall than other bacteria, which contains especially high amounts of a substance called peptidoglycan, they absorb large amounts of the dye and appear purple when viewed under a microscope afterwards.  This positive purple result on a gram stain differentiates these bacteria from all of the other known groups and gives them their name.  As with other bacteria, cell shape is an important factor in the classification of gram-positive bacteria.  There are many well-known genera of gram-positive bacteria that are spherical (“coccus”) in shape, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.  Rod-shaped (“bacillus”) forms include Listeria, Bacillus, Mycobacterium, and Clostridium.", applications: "It is often the case that when bacteria are mentioned, people immediately think of disease.  It is crucial to understand that bacteria are ubiquitous on our planet, and that well over 99.9% are not harmful to humans in any way.  However, a small minority are pathogenic to us, and some can cause dangerous disease.  Many of these pathogenic bacteria are included within the gram-positive group.  While most of the species within the genus Streptococcus are not pathogenic, some causes common diseases in humans such as strep throat, pink eye, and meningitis.  Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that is commonly referred to as “Staph A” by health-care professionals and is capable of causing a range of disorder from skin and bone infections to serious food poisoning.  Finally, several species of Mycobacterium can cause the dangerous respiratory disease tuberculosis.  Mycobacterium species are particularly adept at evolving resistance to the antibiotics that are commonly prescribed to combat them, making tuberculosis increasingly difficult to treat.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", image_three: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Two different kinds of bacteria viewed through a microscope after exposure to a gram stain.

choan = Unite.create(undername: "Choanoflagellates", description: "Choanoflagellates are a small group of unicellular, heterotrophic protists with a peculiar anatomy of great interest to biologists.  There are approximately 150 species of organisms known to science.  Some forms are free-living and use their flagella to propel themselves through the ocean.  Others form colonies and live a sessile existence on the seafloor.  Each individual choanoflagellate cell consists of a bulbous cell body, a distinct “collar” region consisting of a network of cytoskeletal fibers, and a single flagellum.  ATP is spent to wave this flagellum back and forth, creating a current that draws small food particles into the collar where they can be ingested.  In free-swimming species, this flagellar current provides the power for locomotion.  While this specific anatomy is unknown in other protists, it does closely resemble the appearance of function of some animal cells!  Many recent genetic analyses have found that choanoflagellates possess many genes that are unique to only themselves and animal species.  For these reasons, biologists feel strongly that living choanoflagellates are closely related to animals, and that they share a common ancestor with them in the not-so-distant past.", applications: "While choanoflagellates or their products are not used by humans in any direct sense, they remain of great importance to science due to their relatedness to animals.  Much modern zoological research focuses on the anatomy, genetics, and proteins of these protists to try to elucidate how animals might have come into existence.  Since choanoflagellates feed on small organic debris that can fit into their collar region, they are important links in the global carbon cycle.

cilia = Stare.create(undername: "Ciliates", description: "Ciliophorans (or ciliates) are a diverse group of protists that ingest their food.  Over 3500 species have been named and described by scientists, but how many different species actually exist in nature is unknown.  While all of them are unicellular, ciliates vary greatly in size, ranging from a few µm long to some forms that are several orders of magnitude larger and visible with the naked eye!  Members of this group are united by the presence of cilia, structures which have the same internal structure of microtubules as flagella do.  However, in contrast to flagella, cilia are always considerably shorter in length and much more numerous.  Organisms in this group use their cilia to move and/or feed in a large variety of ways.  One of the most unique features of ciliates is the presence of both a macronucleus and a micronucleus in their cells.  As its name would suggest, the macronucleus is the much larger of the two.  It begins its existence as a simple copy of the micronucleus.  As it develops, an incredibly complicated process of gene editing and amplification results in a structure with an enormous number of small chromosomes.  The DNA inside the macronucleus is expressed and used to regulate the activities of the cell.  The much smaller micronucleus is diploid and is used solely to transfer genes from one ciliate to another during the process of conjugation.  In this process, two sexually compatible ciliates of the same species fuse together for a short period of time, make a haploid copy of their micronucleus through meiosis, and exchange one copy with their partner.  The newly obtained haploid micronucleus merges with a copy of the original, reforming the diploid micronucleus.  The two cells then typically separate.  Some time later, the macronucleus in each ciliate will disintegrate, each will make copies of its new diploid micronucleus, and divide several times.  In each new daughter cell, the inherited micronucleus will develop into a macronucleus.", applications: "Ciliates are common consumers in any environment where water is readily available.  This includes the oceans, lakes, ponds, river, and most soils of terrestrial ecosystems.  In fact, looking at a drop of water from any campus pond often reveals several types of common ciliates!  Paramecium spp. is a common lab organism that is often studied in introductory biology courses.  Due to their small size, ciliates tend to prey on bacteria or even smaller protist cells.  Some species have evolved to live inside or on multicellular organisms, including plants and many animals.  Only one species, Balantidium coli, is known to cause any disease in humans.  We acquire this pathogen by drinking water contaminated with resistant stages of the organism called cysts, that have passed through the intestines of infected humans, pigs, or rats.  The cysts become active in the gastrointestinal tract of the new host, where they trigger severe diarrhea.  If untreated, this condition can lead to dangerous levels of dehydration, perforation of the intestinal wall, and even death.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Paramecium species are some of the best known ciliates and are common biology lab organisms.", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_two: "The variety of different ciliates are united in the fact that they move through the use of many short external extensions of their cytoskeleton called cilia and by the presence of both macro- and micro-nuclei.", image_three: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_three: "The variety of different ciliates are united in the fact that they move through the use of many short external extensions of their cytoskeleton called cilia and by the presence of both macro- and micro-nuclei.", image_four: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_four: "The variety of different ciliates are united in the fact that they move through the use of many short external extensions of their cytoskeleton called cilia and by the presence of both macro- and micro-nuclei.")

These flagella normally lie in grooves that permeate the outer cellulose plates that afford these organisms structure and protection.  The actions of the two flagella create a characteristic spinning movement for which the dinoflagellates are named (Greek: dinos “whirling” and flagellum “whip”).  Dinoflagellates are common species in both marine and freshwater habitats, where they exhibit a great variety of feeding strategies.  The ancestors of modern dinoflagellates were almost certainly exclusively photosynthetic organisms, and approximately half of today’s living species utilize this feeding mode as well.  However, many modern dinoflagellate species have evolutionarily traded the ability to make their own food for heterotrophic lifestyles.  These are known to feed on larvae, eggs, other members of the zooplankton, and algae (even other dinoflagellates!).  Finally, many species of living dinoflagellates combine both of these strategies and are termed mixotrophic.  These organisms use their chloroplasts to produce glucose through photosynthesis but are happy to ingest any small food particles they come up against as well!", applications: "Along with diatoms, photosynthetic dinoflagellates are some of the most important members of the phytoplankton in marine and freshwater systems.  By capturing solar energy and using it to build glucose, they make energy available to rest of the aquatic food chain.  An especially important type of dinoflagellate are known as zooxanthellae.  These dinoflagellates form symbiotic relationships with a wide variety of marine animals, in which they live safely inside the animals tissues and, in turn, produce sugars for the animal in photosynthesis.  The most important of these relationships by far occurs with many species of coral.  Through this interaction, coral animals stay well nourished by their dinoflagellate partners and are able to build the massive reefs in the ocean that provide a habitat for tens of thousands of other animal species.  On occasion, during specific times of the year and in waters rich with nutrients, dinoflagellate species may reproduce in enormous amounts creating a “bloom”.  In these situations, some species will produce and release dangerous toxins.  The resulting rusty coloration in the ocean water is known as a red tide.  The toxins contained in the water are powerful enough to kill animals in the water and tend to accumulate in filter-feeding organisms such as clams and oysters.  When these shellfish are in turn consumed by humans, the toxins concentrated within can cause serious illness very quickly.  Saxitoxin is one of the most potent components of this chemical bouquet and leads quickly to muscle paralysis and possible respiratory failure if ingested by humans.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Dinoflagellates are all unicellular but exhibit many different dramatic shapes.", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_two: "The golden color of this coral animal come from the zooxanthallae that is houses inside its tissues.

apico = Stare.create(undername: "Apicomplexans", description: "Apicomplexans are a large group of unicellular protists with several unique structures that delineate them as a related group.  All known species are parasites of animals, many with complicated life cycles that consist of a variety of developmental stages and multiple host animals.  Despite the variety of parasitic lifestyles, all apicomplexans have an infectious cell stage called a sporozoite, which is typically very motile and causes diseases when introduced into the body of an appropriate host animal.  Apicomplexans possess two unique structures inside their cells.  The first gives this group of organisms its name.  The sporozoite stage of these species possesses a set of organelles for penetrating the plasma membranes of host cells called an apical complex.  This complex consists of (among other things) a set of spirally-arranged microtubule fibers, polar rings which surround the microtubules, and organelles called micronemes that secrete enzymes and antigens important for host cell entry.  In addition to the apical complex, most apicomplexans also possess a unique organelle referred to as an apicoplast.  This is essentially a vestigial chloroplast that no longer functions in performing photosynthesis.  Instead, it has evolutionarily taken on other more minor cellular functions such as fatty acid synthesis.  It does, however, point strongly to the idea that modern apicomplexans evolved from photosynthetic ancestors.", applications: "Apicomplexan parasites have been detected in almost all of the animal species in which they have been specifically looked for.  This includes the bodies of humans, in which several kinds of apicomplexans cause terrible diseases.  The most important of these afflictions is malaria, which can occur when sporozoites of one of five possible apicomplexan species is transferred from the saliva of an infected mosquito to the bloodstream of a person.  Once in the blood, sporozoites quickly penetrate the human’s liver cells and there develop into another stage capable of entering and destroying red blood cells.  Malaria is especially difficult to combat due to the fact that the parasite destroys blood cells from the inside out (thereby hiding effectively from our immune system) and because their vector, mosquitos, are abundant and difficult to control effectively.  The worldwide infection estimate lies in the 200 millions, and roughly 600,000 people die of malaria-related symptoms annually.  Another important human disease caused by apicomplexans is toxoplasmosis.  While an adult person with a fully-functioning immune system rarely develops serious illness from the pathogen, for others, such as fetuses, infants, the elderly, and adults with compromised immune systems (such as a person undergoing chemotherapy or one afflicted with AIDS), toxoplasmosis poses a grave threat.  Transmission occurs when a human ingests the cysts of this parasite which can exist in undercooked meat and cat feces.  This is why a doctor typically asks a woman whether she has a cat in the home after she first discovers she is pregnant!  Most people infected with this parasite will develop mild, flu-like symptoms while their immune system fights off the pathogen.

This is best exemplified by the giant kelp (Macrocystis spp.) which may grow to be over 150 feet long and often form dense, underwater forests the in the cold water near the coastlines of major continents.  The giant kelp is so large, that it develops distinct body regions responsible for distinct functions (see picture below).  Its structure consists of many leaf-like blades, a long stipe with many bladders filled with air, and holdfast that anchors the organism to its substrate.", applications: "In some marine areas, brown algae not only help comprise the base of the food chain, but also, due to their size, give basic form and physical structure to aquatic communities.  The kelp forests mentioned above are among the most diverse and productive on planet Earth; giant kelp, for instance, is common along the western coast of the United States (Washington, Oregon, California) where it provides habitat for giant octopus, great white sharks, and a great variety of crabs, mollusks, fish, and many other organisms.  Another large, common brown alga is called Sargassum and grows so densely in parts of the Carribbean Sea that an entire region of it, the Sargasso Sea, has been named for it.  Many species of brown algae are edible and have been traditionally harvested as food in various parts of the world.  Nutritionists refer to brown algae as “complete proteins” because, somewhat surprisingly, they contain all of the amino acids that a human diet requires in their tissues.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Compared to other algae, brown algae often appear brownish or olive-green due to the presence of fucoxanthin pigments.", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_two: "Macrocystis, the giant marine kelp, is a species of brown algae that grows densely under the waters along the western coast of the United States.

diato = Stare.create(undername: "Diatoms", description: "Bacillariophytans, commonly referred to as diatoms, are some of the most important photosynthetic organisms on the planet.  These unicellular algae are found in great numbers in the upper levels of both salt and freshwater, where they comprise a large percentage of the base of the phytoplankton.  These tiny creatures are so abundant that even a teaspoon of ocean water may contain hundreds of thousands of them!  Diatoms are unique in that they produce cell walls made of silica (SiO2), which is the same substance that makes up the majority of what we call glass.  This cell wall, referred to as frustule, consists of 2 halves.  One of the halves is slightly smaller, so that it fits neatly into the other, much like shoebox would fit into its lid.  There is a huge variety in the shape and size of this frustule in the over 100,000 recognized diatom species, but it tends to be bilaterally-symmetrical.  Many diatom species also contain numerous vesicles filled with complicated lipids in their cells in order to help them regulate their buoyancy.", applications: "As abundant autotrophs, diatoms play a vital ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by capturing solar energy and converting it into organic compounds.  This makes energy available for the rest of the food chain, from tiny consumers called zooplankton all the way up to large predatory whales and fish.  Diatoms are so numerous that their collective photosynthetic actions make a significant difference in global carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) levels.  This has led some researchers to seriously suggest that one important way in which we might fight climate change could be to fertilize the oceans with iron and other nutrients, in order to boost diatom growth.  Diatoms are well known in the fossil record.  When diatoms die, their frustules sink to the ocean bottom.  Due again to their great abundance, these remains form vast sediments on the ocean bottom known as diatomaceous earth.  This is mined for a variety of human uses, such as for use as a filtering agent or in garden pest control.  The sharp remains of these glass-like organisms are barely irritating to human skin, but imagine being a soft-bodied snail or worm and dragging your body across them!", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Diatoms come in a great variety of shapes but all share the fact that they are composed of only 1 cell, surrounded by silica frustules.", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_two: "There may be thousands of individual diatoms in even tiny amounts of seawater, producing a beautiful array of glass-covered organisms under the microscope.", image_three: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_three: "Diatomaceous earth, rocks formed mainly from the frustules of deceased diatoms, is mined for a variety of human purposes.", image_four: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_four: "When diatomaceous earth is viewed under the microscope, it's easy to see why the jagged edges of broken frustules make such a good deterrent for soft-bodied animal pests.")
rhiza = Stare.create(undername: "Rhizarians", description: "Rhizarians are small protists that live primarily in the oceans.  While one can generalize many of the basic features of this group of organisms, there seem to be exceptions to each one.  For example, most of the rhizarians possess an amoeba-like body form, moving and feeding with thin, “thread-like” extensions of their cytoplasm called pseudopodia.  Some, however, lack this recognizable anatomy.  Most of the rhizarians are heterotrophic organisms, feeding on bacteria or smaller protists.    Some are mixotrophic, combining heterotrophy and photosynthesis, and one small lineage is completely photosynthetic.  Perhaps the most surprising exception to the general characteristics of this group comes from a species of rhizarian named Guttulinopsis vulgaris.  While all other rhizarians known to science are unicellular organisms, G. vulgaris is a multicellular organism!  The fact that one isolated species of this group has a body that consists of more than one cell lends strong support to the concept that multicellularity evolved on many different occasions within the domain Eukarya.  3 large and diverse lineages of rhizarians exist on Earth today.  First, the radiolarians are tiny oceanic heterotrophs that produce a delicate internal skeleton made of silica (SiO2).  Their tiny pseudopodia extend from the center of their cell in all directions and give the appearance of a tiny spiky ball, or the sun with rays of light streaming from the center.  A second important group of rhizarians are the organisms referred to as foraminiferans.  These amoeba-like protists produce an outer skeleton (called a test) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).  Tiny pseudopodia used to swim and feed extend through tiny pores in this internal skeleton.  Finally, cercozoans are tiny, anatomically-diverse dweller of the oceans, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats.  In many areas, they are probably the most abundant eukaryotic organism in the soil.", applications: "Due their sheer abundance, their short life spans, and because they form tests made out of calcium carbonate, the remains of foraminiferans are major contributors to the formation of sedimentary rocks (especially limestone)!  When they die, foraminiferans sink to the ocean bottom where their cellular components are decomposed.  What remains is the hard outer test.  Over long periods of geologic time, a multitude of these tests are compressed into sedimentary rocks.  These rocks are then moved by geologic forces to various locations on Earth where they might make up impressive landforms or be mined by humans for construction.  Who would’ve thought that the famous white cliffs of Dover on the English coast or the construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt would have been impossible without the lives of these microscopic organisms!", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Many rhizarians use their thread-like pseudopodia in order to pull their bodies through their environment as well as for capturing food particles around them.", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_two: "Foraminiferans produce an external shell (called a test) out of calcium carbonate, sticking their pseudopodia through tiny holes built within.", image_three: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_three: "The famous white cliffs of Dover on the English coast are composed mainly of the remains of foraminiferans tests that accumulated on the seafloor 80-65 million years ago!")
