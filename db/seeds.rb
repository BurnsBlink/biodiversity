cyano = Backer.create(undername: "Cyanobacteria", description: "Cyanobacteria are also commonly referred to as blue-green algae, due to their color which results from the presence of some pigments used in photosynthesis.  As prokaryotes, all cyanobacteria are single-celled, relatively simple organisms.  While this is true, in many species individual cells will cluster together and form globular or filamentous colonies.  Some of these colonies even experience some differentiation, with certain cells taking on a different appearance and becoming specialized for nitrogen fixation.", applications: "Cyanobacteria are important producers in many ecosystems, especially aquatic ones.  Along with many protists, cyanobacteria comprise much of the “algae” at the base of the food chain in lakes and ponds.  These organisms are of special interest to scientists for two very important reasons.  First, biologists commonly agree that some ancient cyanobacterium was the ancestor of the chloroplasts that are found in many modern eukaryotic organisms.  This theory, known as endosymbiosis theory, proposes that an ancestral cyanobacterium was engulfed by an ancestral eukaryotic cell, which did not digest the cyanobacterium.  Instead, the cyanobacterium lived symbiotically inside of its new host, eventually evolved away its independence as a separate organism, and developed into the chloroplasts we observe today.  Evidence for this theory is quite abundant and includes a) the fact that chloroplasts have two plasma membranes, one that is very bacterial in nature b) the ability of chloroplasts to regulate many of their own activities, such as division, and c) the fact that chloroplasts contain their own DNA, which is very similar to the DNA in living cyanobacteria!  Another reason that cyanobacteria are regularly studied is due to the fact that they are the only prokaryotes that produce oxygen as a waste product of photosynthesis.  Fossil evidence tells scientists that ancient cyanobacteria existed on Earth billions of years ago.  Scientists agree that once oxygen-producing photosynthesis evolved in these ancient cyanobacteria, it very likely changed the composition of the atmosphere from a reducing one to one rich in O2!  This radically changed the chemical conditions on our planet and made life as we know it, most of which is heavily dependent on oxygen, possible.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Many cyanobacterial species consist of single-celled organisms linked together in long filamentous colonies")

gpb = Backer.create(undername: "Gram-Positive Bacteria", description: "Gram-positive bacteria are foremost a type of bacteria, meaning that they are unicellular organisms which consist of relatively simple prokaryotic cells.  This group is referred to as “gram-positive”, because they produce a positive result when exposed to the crystal violet dye during a common microbiological technique called a gram stain.  Because these bacteria have a thicker cell wall than other bacteria, which contains especially high amounts of a substance called peptidoglycan, they absorb large amounts of the dye and appear purple when viewed under a microscope afterwards.  This positive purple result on a gram stain differentiates these bacteria from all of the other known groups and gives them their name.  As with other bacteria, cell shape is an important factor in the classification of gram-positive bacteria.  There are many well-known genera of gram-positive bacteria that are spherical (“coccus”) in shape, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.  Rod-shaped (“bacillus”) forms include Listeria, Bacillus, Mycobacterium, and Clostridium.", applications: "It is often the case that when bacteria are mentioned, people immediately think of disease.  It is crucial to understand that bacteria are ubiquitous on our planet, and that well over 99.9% are not harmful to humans in any way.  However, a small minority are pathogenic to us, and some can cause dangerous disease.  Many of these pathogenic bacteria are included within the gram-positive group.  While most of the species within the genus Streptococcus are not pathogenic, some causes common diseases in humans such as strep throat, pink eye, and meningitis.  Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that is commonly referred to as “Staph A” by health-care professionals and is capable of causing a range of disorder from skin and bone infections to serious food poisoning.  Finally, several species of Mycobacterium can cause the dangerous respiratory disease tuberculosis.  Mycobacterium species are particularly adept at evolving resistance to the antibiotics that are commonly prescribed to combat them, making tuberculosis increasingly difficult to treat.", image_one: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", image_two: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", image_three: "https://thumb1.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/153484/444209773/stock-photo-germs-cyanobacteria-or-virus-cells-close-up-illustration-in-a-microscope-444209773.jpg", caption_one: "Two different kinds of bacteria viewed through a microscope after exposure to a gram stain.
